# I am not going to go into detail about how the Equation
# object works, but I will tell you what it does:

# An Equation is initialized with a list of tuples that
# explain how to get each variable of some equation
# (for example, v = v0 + a * t).
# It then has a get_missing_variable(variables) function
# that returns the value of the missing variable given some
# known variables. If the known variables cannot give
# any missing variable, it returns None.
