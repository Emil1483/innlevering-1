# Submission-1

to test my code, please run

```
pip install pylab
pip install re
pip install keyboard

python oppgave-1.py
python oppgave-2-a.py
python oppgave-2-b.py
python oppgave-2-c.py
python oppgave-2-d.py
python oppgave-3.py
python oppgave-4.py
```

You may want to run oppgave-3.py as admin because it depends on the keyboard package for user input.
Also, oppgave-2-c.py and oppgave-2-d.py uses plot(). I have to run these on vs code or spyder because my terminal does not support the plot() command.
